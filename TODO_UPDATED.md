## üöÄ Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Ruby 3.3.5
- Rails 8.0.3
- Node.js 16+
- PostgreSQL

### Build Steps
```bash
# Install dependencies
bundle install
npm install

# Build frontend
npm run build

# Run migrations
rails db:migrate

# Seed data (if needed)
rails db:seed

# Start server
rails server
```

### Production Considerations
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Set up monitoring (Sentry, New Relic)
- [ ] Configure CDN for assets
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Configure SSL/HTTPS
- [ ] Set up load balancing
- [ ] Performance monitoring

## üìù Notes

### Current Architecture
- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **State Management:** TanStack React Query + Zustand
- **Routing:** React Router DOM v6
- **HTTP Client:** Axios with CSRF handling
- **Build Tool:** esbuild (fast compilation)
- **Backend:** Rails 8 API mode for `/api/v1` endpoints

### Key Decisions
1. **Why React Query?** Excellent caching, automatic refetching, optimistic updates
2. **Why esbuild?** Fast builds (~164ms) for development workflow
3. **Why Zustand?** Lightweight, simple state management for auth
4. **Why not Redux?** Overkill for current needs, React Query handles most state

### Known Issues
- Bundle size is 1.5MB (could be reduced with code splitting)
- Some TypeScript `any` types remain (can be improved)
- No WebSocket implementation yet (Action Cable ready)
- API requires authentication (expected behavior)

### Migration Notes
- All ERB views are now obsolete (can be removed)
- All frontend routes now handled by React Router
- Backend is now API-only for frontend (RESTful JSON)
- Authentication still uses Devise sessions (cookie-based)
